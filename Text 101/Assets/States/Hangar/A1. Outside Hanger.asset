  storyText: 'Faster. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    At
    least 10 of the guarding the gangar door. Typical.


    Could try punching my
    way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.


    What should
    I do?

    1. Take them head on -  rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way to
    the emergency exit.'
