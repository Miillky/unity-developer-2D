  storyText: 'Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end
    up dumped in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and
    patched together with plate metal and thick red wires.


    You have no idea
    where you are. And your head hurts.


    So, what to do now, slugger?


    1.
    Wait it out. My head hurts.

    2. Slam into the door with all my might.'
